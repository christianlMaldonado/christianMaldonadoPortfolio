## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Here lies all the code to my gihub page .io website

Here all the projects taken in the UC Berkley Code Camp and projects included in College Coursework. All code will range from c++, HTML5, Css3, Javascript, bootstrap, jquery, and ajax.

In the Main page named index.html you will be given choices to click on projects previously worked on.

I have UC Berkeley and Monterey Peninsula College to choose from as of now. 

Any other Projects worked on will be added to this website.
